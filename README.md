# MIBC-Predictive-models

This branch contains computed image features for the discovery cohort

# Discovery cohort (subset 963 + 1042) includes five feature categories:

1. Image texture features.
2. Nucleus morphology features.
3. Clustering feautres.
4. Spatial statistics based on IHC imaging.
5. Cell populational features.

# External validation cohort only includes four feature categories:

1. Image texture features.
2. Nucleus morphology features.
3. Clustering feautres.
4. Cell populational features.

Spatial statistics were missing due to lack of IHC stains
